Azure Sentinel To-Go
====================

Sentinel To-Go is a project that expedites the deployment of a Microsoft Azure Sentinel cloud solution without having to write sequence of programming commands to create it.
It leverages Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to orchestrate, create and deploy the infrastructure declaratively and in a consistent manner.
The main goal of the project is to empower security researchers to deploy, learn and perform research with Microsoft Azure Sentinel.
