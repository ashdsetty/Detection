The Blacksmith Project
======================

The Blacksmit project focuses on providing dynamic easy-to-use templates for security researches to model and provision resources needed to automatically deploy applications in the cloud.
It currently leverages "`AWS CloudFormation <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/>`_" to model infrastructure and architecture of applications in AWS.

Goals
*****

* Expedite research by providing dynamic templates to deploy applications in the cloud.
* Translate favorite applications or tools into cloud templates for developing and testing.
* Replicate research environments for training purposes
* Learn more about AWS CloudFormation
