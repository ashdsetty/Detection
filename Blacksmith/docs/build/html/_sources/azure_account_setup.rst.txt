Azure Account Creation
======================

Azure Free Account
##################

The Azure free account includes free access to popular Azure products for 12 months, $200 USD credit to spend for the first 30 days, and access to more than 25 products that are always free.
This is an excellent way for new users to get started and explore.
To sign up, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft or GitHub account.
Credit card information is used for identity verification only.
You won’t be charged for any services until you upgrade.

When your Free Tier expires, Azure starts charging the regular rates for any not "always-free" services and resources that you're using.

To avoid charges while on the Free Tier, you must keep your usage below the `Free Tier limits <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/#new-products>`_.
You are charged for any usage that exceeds the limits. To help you stay within the limits, you can track your Free Tier usage and set a billing alarm to notify you if you start incurring charges.

* `Available Azure 12 months free services <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/#new-products>`_

Remember that you are charged **ONLY** for the services that you use.

The first step to using Azure is to sign up.
You may sign up directly through Azure.com, with the help of a Microsoft representative, or through a partner.
If you’re new to Azure, you may sign up for an Azure free account to start exploring with $200 USD free credit and free services.
