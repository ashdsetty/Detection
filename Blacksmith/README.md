# Blacksmith

The Blacksmith project focuses on providing dynamic easy-to-use templates for security researches to model and provision resources to automatically deploy applications and small networks in the cloud. It currently leverages [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and [Microsoft Azure Resource Manager (ARM)]() templates to implement infrastructure as code for cloud solutions.

# Goals

* Expedite research by providing dynamic templates to deploy applications in the cloud.
* Translate favorite applications or tools into cloud templates for developing and testing.
* Replicate research environments for training purposes
* Learn more about AWS CloudFormation
* Learn more about Microsoft's Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates

# Getting Started

* [Blacksmith ReadTheDocs](https://blacksmith.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
